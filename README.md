# Analysis-of-Free-Falling-wedge-onto-Calm-water-usinig-overset-grid-method-in-OpenFoam
	This repo is my undergraduate final year project. Simulation of free falling wedges of 
base angle 90 deg and 120 deg under gravity onto the calm water surface.
	The mesh motion is handled using Chimera Grid or Overset Grid Approah.
	The motion of the wedge is calculated using 6-DoF model.
	The behaviour of the wedge influences both fluids air and water. the multiphase model used
